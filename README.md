# Oatgen

=== Welcome to Oatgen! ===

Oatgen is a tool for generating randomized level files for the game Oatmeal.
I am aware the game already has a random level generator, but this tool allows you to save the random levels you generate!

=== Intructions ===

1. Open Oatgen.bat
2. A text file called custom.txt should be in the Output folder
3. Open your game's directory (default location is C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Oatmeal)
4. From there, go to OatmealWindows>Oatmeal_data>CustomLevels (sorry mac users this only works on windows)
5. Drag the text file in that directory & rename it what slot you want the level to be loaded in (ex. custom5.txt will be loaded in the 5th level save slot)
6. Run game and enjoy :)

=== PLEASE NOTE ===

I created this tool for myself and am terrible at coding, so sorry if it's not the best.

Most levels you generate will do virtually nothing. The base game's generator has this problem too, it's just a risk you take when randomly generating levels.

This tool is open source, so feel free to tinker with it.

==== Thank You and Have Fun! :) ====
